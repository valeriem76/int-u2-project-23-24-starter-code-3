    <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
    <p>Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. Climate change is mostly caused by humans, for example, people have been burning fossil fuels which produces heat trapping gasses and affects the weather. This issue can affect environments as climate change is causing temperatures to rise causing more heat waves and wildfires.</p>

    <h2>Why care?</h2>
    <p>You should care for this issue as not only does climate change affect the globe, but also affects us humans. Climate change can cause extreme weather events to happen, leading to events like wildfires, heat waves, and droughts. But these events have also affected many peoples lives as it has destroyed homes and have killed many. There are families who are living in poverty with less food and worse health due to high temperatures from climate change and soon temperatures will become very high to where it affects us all. If we don't fight now then our futures will be ruined.</p>

    <h2>How to help</h2>
    <p>There are many ways you can help prevent climate change, for example saving energy at home because electricity is powered by coal, oil, and gas. Another example is to reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle because items like electronics and clothes cause carbon emissions.</p>
